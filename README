We employed the human ventricular myocyte model proposed by ten Tusscher et al., (AJP, 2004, 2006) as a unit model.

all M cell units
2-Dimensional tissue model (sheet model with 200 um tickness)

longitudinal direction Propagation velocity = 60 [cm/s]
transverse direction Propagation velocity = 20 [cm/s]

Basic setting
Diffusive coefficent D_l = 0.00265 [cm^2/ms]
Diffusive coefficent D_t = 0.00039 [cm^2/ms]

space discrete (delta x) = 200 [um]
time span = 0.1 [ms]
